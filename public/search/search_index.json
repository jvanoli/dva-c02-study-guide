More and more companies are adopting newer technologies that will allow them to grow and increase returns. The Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud is one example of it. There are more than a million active users of Amazon Web Services. These users are a mix of small businesses, independent contractors, large enterprises, developers, students, and many more. There is no doubt that AWS already has a community of users, and the number of newcomers is increasing rapidly each day.</p> <p>With AWS, you don\u2019t have to purchase and manage your infrastructure. It is a considerable cost saving for your company, and it is a sigh of relief as well for your sysadmin team. Although AWS offers a huge collection of services and products that require little configuration, they also offer traditional ones like VMs and storage devices that work similarly to their physical counterparts. This means that transitioning from an on-premises type of environment to an AWS virtualized environment should be straightforward.</p> <p>We think that developers benefit the most from the cloud. You can access your applications from anywhere if you have a browser and an Internet connection (and maybe an SSH/RDP client too). You can spin up machines in a matter of minutes from a catalog of OS and versions that suit your needs. You also have control over your storage devices, which you can also provision and de-provision easily. Aside from traditional VMs, AWS also has other options for you, such as container instances, batch instances, and serverless models that can easily be integrated with APIs. You also do not need to worry about databases. You can host them on your own in VMs with your own licenses or use AWS-provided licenses, or you can even use a managed database, so you do not need to worry about infrastructure. If these are too much for a simple app that you just want to test, AWS has a platform-as-a-service solution wherein you can simply deploy your code, and the service handles the infrastructure for you. In essence, AWS has already provided the tools that its users need to quickly take advantage of the cloud.</p> <p>With all of the benefits presented in using AWS, the true value of being an AWS Certified Developer has your knowledge and skills in developing in AWS recognized by the industry. With this recognition, you\u2019ll gain more opportunities for career growth, financial growth, and personal growth as well. Certified individuals can negotiate for higher salaries, aim for promotions, or land higher job positions. Becoming an AWS Certified Developer Associate is also a great way to start on your journey in DevOps, which is one of the most in-demand and well-compensated roles in the IT industry today. This certificate is a must-have in your portfolio if you wish to progress your career in AWS.</p> <p>We took extra care to come up with these study guides and cheat sheets. However, this is meant to be  just a supplementary resource when preparing for the exam. We highly recommend working on hands-on sessions and practice exams to further expand your knowledge and improve your test-taking skills.</p>"},{"location":"#aws-certified-developer-associate-exam-overview","title":"AWS CERTIFIED DEVELOPER ASSOCIATE EXAM OVERVIEW","text":"<p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) began the Global Certification Program with the primary purpose of validating the technical skills and knowledge for building secure and reliable cloud-based applications using the AWS platform.

These two will be your primary source of information when studying AWS. You need to be well-versed in many AWS products and services since you will almost always be using them in your work. I recommend checking out Tutorials Dojo\u2019s AWS Cheat Sheets, which provide a summarized but highly informative set of notes and tips for your review on these services.</p> <p>Services to study for: 1. Amazon EC2 / ELB / Auto Scaling \u2013 Be comfortable with integrating EC2 to ELBs and Auto Scaling. Study the commonly used AWS CLI commands, APIs and SDK code under these services. Focus as well on security, maintaining high availability, and enabling network connectivity from your ELB to your EC2 instances.  2. AWS Elastic Beanstalk \u2013 Know when Elastic Beanstalk is more appropriate to use than other computing or infrastructure-as-a-code solutions like CloudFormation. Experiment with the service yourself in your AWS account, and understand how you can deploy and maintain your own application in Beanstalk. 3. Amazon ECS \u2013 Study how you can manage your own cluster using ECS. Also, figure out how ECS can be integrated into a CI/CD pipeline. Be sure to read the FAQs thoroughly since the exam includes multiple questions about containers. 4. AWS Lambda \u2013 The best way to learn Lambda is to create a function yourself. Also, remember that Lambda allows custom runtimes that a customer can provide himself. Figure out what services can be integrated with Lambda and how Lambda functions can capture and manipulate incoming events. Lastly, study the Serverless Application Model (SAM). 5. Amazon RDS / Amazon Aurora \u2013 Understand how RDS integrates with your application through EC2, ECS, Elastic Beanstalk, and more. Compare RDS to DynamoDB and Elasticache and determine when RDS is best used. Also, know when it is better to use Amazon Aurora than Amazon RDS and when RDS is more useful than hosting your own database inside an EC2 instance. 6. Amazon DynamoDB \u2013 You should have a complete understanding of the DynamoDB service as this is very crucial in your exam. Read the DynamoDB documentation since it is more detailed and informative than the FAQ. As a developer, you should also know how to provision your own DynamoDB table, and you should be capable of tweaking its settings to meet application requirements. 7. Amazon Elasticache \u2013 Elasticache is a caching service you\u2019ll often encounter in the exam. Compare and contrast Redis from Memcached. Determine when Elasticache is more suitable      than DynamoDB or RDS.  8. Amazon S3 \u2013 S3 is usually your go-to storage for objects. Study how you can secure your objects through KMS encryption, ACLs, and bucket policies. Know how S3 stores your objects to keep them highly durable and available. Also, learn about lifecycle policies. Compare S3 to EBS and EFS to know when S3 is more preferred than the other two. 9. Amazon EFS \u2013 EFS is used to set up file systems for multiple EC2 instances. Compare and contrast S3 to EFS and EBS. Study file encryption and EFS performance optimization as well. 10. Amazon Kinesis \u2013 There are usually tricky questions on Kinesis, so you should read its documentation too. Focus on Kinesis Data Streams and explore the other Kinesis services. Familiarize yourself with Kinesis APIs, Kinesis Sharding, and integration with storage services such as S3 or compute services like AWS Lambda. 11. Amazon API Gateway \u2013 API gateway is usually used together with AWS Lambda as part of the serverless application model. Understand API Gateway\u2019s structure, such as resources, stages, and methods. Learn how you can combine API Gateway with other AWS services, such as Lambda or CloudFront. Determine how you can secure your APIs so that only a select number of people can execute them. 12. Amazon Cognito \u2013 Cognito is used for mobile and web authentication. You usually encounter Cognito questions in the exam along with Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB. This usually involves some mobile application requiring an easy sign-up/sign-in feature from AWS. It is highly suggested that you try using Cognito to better understand its features. 13. Amazon SQS \u2013 Study the purpose of different SQS queues, timeouts, and how your messages are handled inside queues. Messages in an SQS queue are not deleted when polled, so be sure to read on that as well. There are different polling mechanisms in SQS, so you should compare and contrast each. 14. Amazon CloudWatch \u2013 CloudWatch is a primary monitoring tool for all your AWS services. Verify that you know what metrics can be found under CloudWatch monitoring and what metrics require a CloudWatch agent installed. Also, study CloudWatch Logs, CloudWatch Alarms, and Billing monitoring. Differentiate the kinds of logs stored in CloudWatch vs. logs stored in CloudTrail. 15. AWS IAM \u2013 IAM is the security center of your cloud. Therefore, you should familiarize yourself with the different IAM features. Study how IAM policies are written and what each section in the policy means. Understand the usage of IAM user roles and service roles. You should have read up on the best practices whitepaper in securing your AWS account through IAM. 16. AWS KMS \u2013 KMS contains keys that you use to encrypt EBS, S3, and other services. Know what these services are. Learn the different types of KMS keys and in which situations each type of key is used. 17. AWS CodeBuild / AWS CodeCommit / AWS CodeDeploy / AWS CodePipeline \u2013 These are your tools for implementing CI/CD in AWS. Study how you can build applications in CodeBuild (<code>buildspec</code>), and how you\u2019ll prepare configuration files (<code>appspec</code>) for CodeDeploy. CodeCommit is a git repository, so having knowledge in Git will be beneficial. I suggest that you build a simple pipeline of your own in CodePipeline to see how you should manage your code deployments. It is also important to learn how you can roll back to your previous application version after a failed deployment. The whitepapers above should have explained in-place deployments and blue/green deployments and how to perform automation 18. AWS CloudFormation \u2013 Study the structure of CloudFormation scripts and how you can use them to build your infrastructure. Be comfortable with both JSON and YAML formats. Read a bit about StackSets. List down the services that use CloudFormation in the backend for     provisioning AWS resources, such as AWS SAM, and processes, such as in CI/CD.</p> <p>Aside from the concepts and services, you should study the AWS CLI, the different commonly used APIs (for services such as EC2, EBS, or Lambda), and the AWS SDKs. Read up on the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) and AWS Application Migration Service, as well as these that may come up in the exam. It will also be very helpful to have experience interacting with AWS APIs and SDKs and troubleshooting any errors that you encounter while using them.</p>"},{"location":"#common-exam-scenarios","title":"Common Exam Scenarios","text":""},{"location":"#lambda","title":"Lambda","text":"Scenario Solution An application running in a local server is converted to a Lambda function.
