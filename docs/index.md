# AWS Certified Developer (DVA-C02) Study Guide

This website contains the Study Guide put together while studying for the AWS Certified Developer (DVA-C02) exam.

I basically put it in this format for several reasons:

* I found writing in markdown quite confortable
* I've experience using Material for MKDocs in several proyects at work
* Pusblish using Material for MKDocs to Github Pages is a breeze
* Having the source in Markdown I can also publish to ePub (using PanDoc) 
* In ePub format is good I can read this Study Guide on my Kindle
* I want to have all my docs version controlled in Git
