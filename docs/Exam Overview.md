# Exam Overview

Amazon Web Services (AWS) began the Global Certification Program with the primary purpose of validating the technical skills and knowledge for building secure and reliable cloud-based applications using the AWS platform. By successfully passing the AWS exam, individuals can prove their AWS expertise to their current and future employers.

The AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate exam was the first AWS certification that was launched in 2013, followed by two other role-based certifications: Systems Operations (SysOps) Administrator and Developer Associate later that year. AWS is always releasing new development services and features on its cloud platform; thus, there is a continuous stream of updates on its exam content. Some changes are minor ones, while others are major updates that overhaul the entire certification test.

The very first version of the AWS Certified Developer - Associate exam (DVA-C00) and was released in [January 2014](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2014/01/13/new-certification-exams-available-for-developers-and-sysops-administrators/). Four years later, in June 2018, AWS released the updated version of this test with an exam code of [DVA-C01](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/check-out-the-updated-aws-certified-developer-associate-exam/). AWS unveiled the third iteration of this test with [DVA-C02 as its latest exam code](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/training-and-certification/updated-aws-certified-developer-associate-registration-now-open/). You might notice that for every major exam update, the last digit of the exam code is incremented, so expect that the next one will be called DVA-C03 after several years. It’s quite important to know the relevant details of the AWS exam version to ensure that you are using up-to-date review materials

## Exam Scoring
You can get a score from 100 to 1,000 with a minimum passing score of **720** when you take the AWS Certified Developer Associate exam. AWS uses a scaled scoring model to associate scores across multiple exam types that may have different levels of difficulty. Your complete score report will be sent to you by email 1 - 5 business days after your exam. However, as soon as you finish your exam, you’ll immediately see a pass or fail notification on the testing screen.

For individuals who unfortunately do not pass their exams, you must wait 14 days before you are allowed to retake the exam. There is no hard limit on the number of attempts you can retake an exam. Once you pass, you’ll receive various benefits, such as a discount coupon which you can use for your next AWS exam.

Once you receive your score report via email, the result should also be saved in your AWS Certification account already. The score report contains a table of your performance on each domain and it will indicate whether you have met the level of competency required for these domains. Take note that you do not need to achieve competency in all domains for you to pass the exam. At the end of the report, there will be a score performance table that highlights your strengths and weaknesses, which will help you determine the areas you need to improve on.
